 # DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS IN JAVA

This repository contains **daily practice questions** on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in Java.  
I am uploading 1–2 questions every day to build consistency and improve problem‑solving skills. The aim is to create a structured collection of problems that cover fundamental concepts as well as advanced topics, making this repository a valuable resource for students, beginners, and anyone preparing for coding interviews.

## 📌 Contents
- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Linked List  
- Stack & Queue  
- Recursion  
- Sorting & Searching  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Other Topics (Bit Manipulation, Greedy, Backtracking, Hashing, Miscellaneous)

## 🎯 Goal
The primary goal of this repository is to strengthen the understanding of core DSA concepts through practical coding exercises. By solving problems daily, I am building discipline and sharpening logical thinking. This repository will also serve as a reference for peers and juniors who want to learn Java and practice DSA in a systematic way.  

Each solution is written in clean, modular Java code with a focus on readability and efficiency. Over time, this collection will grow into a comprehensive set of problems that can help in mastering DSA and preparing for competitive programming or technical interviews.
